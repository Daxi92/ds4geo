# The Course
This GitHub repository contains all of the learning material for the Introduction to Data Science for Geologists (DS4GEO) course. The course is running for the first time in Winter Semester 2020 and is taught by Dr Samuel Barrett (samuel.barrett(at)uibk.ac.at).

The course is a mix of short lectures, practical workshops and discussion. It will take place on Wednesday afternoons at 15:30 until ca. 17:45, between 07/10/2020 and 9/12/2020 inclusive (10 sessions) in the Geology Institute Schausammlung. Bring a laptop!

Full details about the course, structure, assessment, etc. are here: https://github.com/ds4geo/ds4geo/blob/master/Course%20Information.md

# COVID-19
This course is indended to be highly interactive, involving numerous class discussions and interactive workshops. It is therefore allowed to take place in-person on campus despite the current COVID-19 situation (as of 04.10.20).

Please closely follow the latest guidelines here:
https://www.uibk.ac.at/fakultaeten-servicestelle/praesenzpruefungen.html.de

In particular:
* Maintain 2 meter social distancing
* Wear mouth and nose protection in all University Buildings
* Do not attend class if you have symptoms! In case of symptoms, please follow the procedures at the above link.

In addition:
* At my request, please also wear mouth and nose protection during class, even when seated.

If any course participant has any concerns about attending or about the regulations in class, please contact me as soon as possible (samuel.barrett(at)uibk.ac.at).

In order to maintain social distancing during the workshops (which require interaction amongst students and with the lecturer), we will use the UIBK video conferencing system to allow screensharing and flexible group collaboration. A link will be shared with course participants by email. If any student cannot attend class due to illness (please contact me if this is the case), or if the entire class needs to be taught remotely, the same system (and link) will be used.
